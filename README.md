## Introduction

In nature, an organisms genes determine it's ability to survive in it's environment. Organisms with better genes will have a bigger chance to survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their good genes. The gene pool of the organism will adapt to their current environment as the individuals with worse genes will not survive long enough to reproduce and pass on these genes.\
\
In this project, I want to simulate an organism with a certain set of traits determined by certain genes and see how different environments and situations affect the way the evolve over time. Not all genes will thrive in every environment, factors like predation, food availability and even the current population's size and genes.
## Project Description
I will be creating a creature called a "Blip". They need to eat food in order to survive. After a certain time, they will die of old age. Blips have an urge to reproduce, when the reproductive urge is higher than their hunger, they will look for a mate produce offspring. Until they grow up, Blip pups will have all traits halved.
### Blips traits: 
- Vision radius
- Speed
- Reproductive urge
- Cammouflage vs Attractiveness

Every Trait has a gene linked to it that defines the trait. 
When Blips reproduce they pass their genes on to the next generation. Whenever this happens there is a small chance that a gene will mutate to allow room for growth. 
## Experiments
- High vs Low food availability
- Effects of predation
- Geological Separation
## Results

## Takeaway

## What's next?

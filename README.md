## Introduction
In nature, an organisms genes determine it's ability to survive in it's environment. Organisms with better genes will have a bigger chance to survive long enough to reproduce and pass on their good genes. The gene pool of the organism will adapt to their current environment as the individuals with worse genes will not survive long enough to reproduce and pass on these genes.
In this project, I want to simulate an organism with a certain set of traits determined by certain genes and see how different environments and situations affect the way the evolve over time.
